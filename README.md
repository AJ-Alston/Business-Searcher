# Business-searcher NoSQL Project 

Project Overview

This project involves performing transformations and actions on a NoSQL database using Python. The main goal is to demonstrate how to retrieve data from NoSQL databases and convert mathematical concepts into code.

Objectives

By understanding this code, you will:

Understand fundamental concepts and features of NoSQL databases.
Learn to retrieve data from NoSQL databases using Python.
Convert mathematical concepts into code to perform specific operations.

Technology Requirements:

Python 3.10
Cython 3.0.0
UnQLite 0.9.6
Jupyter Notebook
Project Files

Through this project, you will gain experience working with NoSQL databases and understand how to use Python to conduct several fundamental operations on them. Unlike conventional relational databases, NoSQL allows data to be stored more freely without rigid schemas. Additionally, they are capable of handling massive amounts of data quickly.

This project was apart of CSE 511 at Arizona State University (Summer '24)
